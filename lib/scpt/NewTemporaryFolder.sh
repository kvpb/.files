# Why I did not write this the negative 'is not' (`[ ! -d "~/Temporary"`) way:
#
#  if [ ! -d "~/Temporary" ]; then # If the UACOSUTF is not [does not exist as] a directory in the current user's home then...
#    if [ -L "~/Temporary" ]; then # If the UACOSUTF is not [does not exists as] a symbolic link in the CUH then...
#      mv ~/Temporary ~/.Trash/ # Put the unof ACOS usr tmp folder symlink to the cur usr's trash, and...
#      mkdir ~/Temporary # Make an UACOSUTF in the CUH.
#    else # ... Else...
#      mkdir -p ~/Temporary # Make the UACOSUTF in the CUH.

# It would cause a sign inversion at some point to be kept clean. Checking that it doesn't exist as a symlink confronts to a weird sequence of events where one could ask '... Or else what?'.
